# Fine-tuning object detector on deep ocean data

## Set up your environment
Personally, I use mamba, but conda will work as well. To create a new env with all the dependencies use the following command:
```bash
mamba env create -f conda.yaml
```
To update the env is new packages are added to yaml file: 
```bash
conda env update -n ocean --file conda.yaml
```
